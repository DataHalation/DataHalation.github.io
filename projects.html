								<h2>CS3733 Software Engineering (in collaboration with Brigham & Women’s Hospital)</h2>
								<h3>Java</h3>
								<p>Ten person student teams working in a class competition to apply Agile development methodologies and
									software design patterns in Java to create an indoor pathfinding application, map builder, COVID-screening
									survey, and integrated service request modules for Brigham & Women’s Hospital. The software systems that
									student teams created were to inform the hospital representatives about potential features, user interfaces, or
									design approaches that they might consider implementing.</p>
								<li>As a project manager, I was responsible for managing project tasks, coordinating the team, and keeping all of the
									members motivated</li>
								<li>As a product owner, I maintained the product backlog and sprint backlog. I also coordinated the team’s sizing and
									prioritizing of user stories</li>
								<li>As part of the UI team, wrote code daily to interface with the algorithm and database teams</li>
								<br>
								<h2>CS4516 Advanced Networks</h2>
								<p>Researched and implemented the creation of a “Centrally-Managed Perimeter Access Control” project, an
									OpenFlow powered software-defined network firewall for honeypotting bad-actors, based on paper by Prof.
									Craig Shue.</p>
								<h2>Major Qualifying Project (MQP): Seethrough VR</h2>
								<p>Worked with a team of six to create an augmented reality RC car application. Developed a webserver capable
									of remotely handling commands sent to a Raspberry Pi while streaming a video feed from an attached camera.</p>
								<h2>Interactive Qualifying Project (IQP): Predicting the Price of a Stock</h2>
								<p>Created multiple prediction models (Fourier, Savitzky-Golay) within MATLAB, utilizing real-world stock
									data sourced from(to make short-term price predictions during a simulated trading period.</p>
								<h2>CS 4241 Webware Computational Technology For Network Information Systems</h2>
								<p>Creation of a two-tier web application with a SQLite database, OAuth login, and React components.</p>
